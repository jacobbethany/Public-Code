/*
 Code by: Jacob A. Bethany.

 This file contains code for a generic linked list that is very widely applicable
 in its usage.

 TODO:
 =====
 -For group allocation nodes, make a function to find the first unused.
 IE: SetVariableBlock ( FindNewGroupNode (  ), &VariableBlockStructure, sizeof ( VariableBlockStructure ) );

 -Code FreeNode() / FreeNodeEx() to check to see if the node being freed is a group allocation node and, if so,
 opt not to free any of the information.
 If it's a non root node you could free everything but the variable block without any issues, but if it IS the
 root node, freeing anything would invalidate the list, because it would lose the pointer to the start of the
 variable block that is shared across the entire group. This is essentially just a safety check incase someone
 using this code is doing so incorrectly.

 -Create functions to read and write lists to files.
 (Either use callbacks like below, or empty virtual functions to subclass.)
 WriteList ( unsigned short *FileName, (*writecallback)(void*lpData) )
{{
 open file.

 while ( enumerate ( (void **) &VariableBlock ) )
         writecallback ( VariableBlock );

 close file.
}}

 ReadList ( unsigned short *FileName, (*readcallback)(FILE*in) )
{{
 open file

 VARIABLE_BLOCK_STRUCTURE *pVariableBlock = 0;
 while ( pVariableBlock = readcallback() )
         AddNode ( pVariableBlock, this ->StructureSize );

 close file
}}

 ___________________________________________________________________________________________

 NOTES:
 =====
 -Allocation types:
 *Group (a cluster of nodes of the same variable block datatype allocated all at once.)
  -This will always memset all of the variable blocks after allocation; this means setting
 the data in the variable block of each node will have to be done after the group allocation.

 *Individual -- One node allocated at a time.
 -->AddUniqueNode() // AddNode()

 *Unique -- Only one node of this 'type' can be allocated. (Current a callback function must be supplied to check for this.)
 -->AddUniqueNode()

 *Associative -- All nodes are defaulted to a blank association; only one associative name can be given per node,
  and only one node may have an associative name. The association can be set as the node is created for indiviaully allocated
  linked lists, or they can be made after the list is already allocated for all list types.
 -->AssociateNode()

 *Pointer Lists -- The datasize is 0 (the variable block is just a pointer to something.)
 -->AddNode() // AddUniqueNode()

 -Useful Subclasses:
 *FreeCallback() --required.
 *GetAlphaSortString() --Optional, needed for AlphaSort(). [not for AlphaSortEx()]
 *GetSortLong() --Optional, needed for LongSort(). [not for LongSortEx()]

 -Freeing:
 *Always call FreeEx(). --This will call the other freeing functions and call backs as needed.
 You should free any linked lists and any other data within your Variable Block during the
 FreeCallback() that you subclassed.

 ___________________________________________________________________________________________

 NOTE: As of Monday, February 23, 2015 @ 9:58 PM PST, all Node ->lpData
 pointers are pushed forward by LINKED_LIST_PTR_SIZE (sizeof(char*)) bytes.
 The reason for this is to include a pointer to the parent in the first (sizeof(char*))
 bytes of each lpData. This makes the function GetParent() possible.
 **This also means that all freeing functions need to call in this fashion now:

 free ( ((char *)FreeNode ->lpData) - sizeof(char*) );

 so keep that in mind if you add any new freeing functions...
 Use: FreeVariableBlock ( LINKED_LIST *Node );

 NOTES: (DEPRECATED)
 ======
 *FreeGroup/FreeGroupEx will now automatically be called by Free()/FreeEx() when needed.
 --So call Free() when you don't need a special callback to free things within the variable
 block of your linked list nodes, and call FreeEx() when you do -- with the FreeCallback()
 function override in place in the extended class you've made for your list that tells the
 functions how to free the complex region of the variable block.

 **FreeGroup() --> for generic linked lists that were allocated in mass by NewGroup(), but also works for any kind
 of generic list, including lists created by NewNode() and lists created by both methods then combined using Append().

 **FreeGroupEx() --> for complex linked lists (ones that have dynamically allocated memory within the structure contained in
 the complex region of the linked list nodes. This function works for ALL kinds of lists that require callbacks.

 **Free() --> for generic individually allocated lists only. (Will NOT work for Group allocated lists or lists that require callbacks to free.)
 **FreeEx() -->for complex individually allocated lists only. (Will NOT work for Group allocated lists.)

 In short, the group freeing functions will always work for callback/non-callback freeing of lists, but will be slower in some cases owing
 to the extensive checking that is required to see what memory is freeable and what memory is not.
