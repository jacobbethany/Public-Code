# Public-Code
The code in this branch consists of code that I've written in various languages after discussing different ideas or approaches to common problems with friends and coworkers;
and things that I made for fun and out of curiosity. As of 2021-03-05, when I'm writing this description, most of it wasn't has no any practical purpose or inclusion within
any larger projects. The most recent c++ permutation algorithm and variable dumping subroutine for Perl are a couple of exceptions. It's also worth mentioning that most of the
code is not indicative of my typical coding style or approach, as the majority of the code here was not created for professional consumption.
