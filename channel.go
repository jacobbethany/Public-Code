/*
 This code was created by Jacob Bethany on 2019-05-29 @ 10:05 AM.
 To run: "go run channel.go"

 Purpose:
 To understand the <- operator.

 Consequently, I've learned the following things:
 The Go keyword starts a new thread with the given function (it can be created on the fly like "go func(){ do stuff here... }()"
 Channels can be read-only, if you define them in the parameter of a function with the <- operator.

 The syntax for assigning an array of items is:

 var [variable name] = [array item count][type] { ..., ..., ... }
 or
 [variable name] := [array item count][type] { ... }

 Note the position of the equation symbol (between the variable name and the type -- a bizarre construct).

 While loops don't exist in Golang and must be emulated like this:
 for dummy := 0; true; dummy++ {
     ..do somethingg here...
 }



 Expectations:
 I thought that the output would be random elements from { "This", "is", "only", "a", "test", "..." } by having two
 threads out of sync with the addition of a Sleep command in the spawned worker thread.
 I was thinking that it was likely that we'd only see "This" 60 times, since the main thread would complete so much more quickly.

 Results:
 Reading from a channel breaks concurrency, and the main thread locks itself to wait for something to exist in the pipe.
 This is a timeout of some duration, I think, because I had the main loop try to read more than what existed and the compiled
 application  eventually complained about all threads being deadlocked.

 //There is no need to make an array of 100 strings, since it queues each string inserted into the channel for each contiguous read to remove.

 //This is the way to do it, since it queues each item that is added to the channel to be "popped out" during each read.

 //Interestingly, because reading from a channel breaks the concurrency by locking the requesting thread until there's something to read, we can just do this:
 if ( 0 == strings.Compare ( "done", <- messages ) ) {
      fmt.Printf ( "The worker thread finished its execution, successfully.\n" );
      os.Exit ( 0 ); //successful termination.
 }


 //If we're still executing, then we had an unexpected result.
 fmt.Printf ( "The worker thread returned an unexpected value.\n" );
 os.Exit ( 1 ); //Unsuccessful termination.

} //end of main function.
