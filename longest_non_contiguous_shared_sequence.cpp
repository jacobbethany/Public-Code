 This code was written on 2019-12-09 by Jacob Bethany.
 Purpose: To find and display the longest of all common non-contiguous subsequences between two arrays and its length.
 I do this by masking the shorter of the two arrays with each possible combination of values to use for finding similarly
 ordered but non-contiguous sequences.
