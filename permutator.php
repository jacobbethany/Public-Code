 Code written on 2019_06_06 by Jacob Bethany.
 Purpose: To try to create every possible permutation of an array's values.

 Method:
 Step1:
 I rotate the array to the left until it reaches its starting point.

 Step2:
 I swap i, and i+gap_size, starting at every point in the array.
 I increase the gap size for later; I spawn a new recursive function call with the new array as the "starting point"; then I repeat step1 (in the main function -- though the recursive call does it, too).

 Step3:
 When the gap size exceeds the length of the array, I break out of the main loop and display the keys of the associative array of permutations.
 Note: The keys of the associative array are used to ensure that all members are unique.

 This has been tested with array lengths of 3 and 4, so far.
