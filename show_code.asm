; Created on 2019-04-27 by Jacob Bethany
; Purpose: To see if it would be possible to make a program dump its own opcode values.
;
; Note: The final opcode in this program isn't really completely detectable, with the way that I'm doing this.
; A few opcodes at the bottom of the script are missing (as well as some functions below the label that is used).
;
;Write a program to show the opcode values of the program as it's running.
;Todo:
;[X] Get the EIP value in a global variable as the first instruction of the code.
;[X] Jump to the bottom of the code by a label.
;[X] Store the EIP value in another variable to use as an offset from the first.
;[X] Jump back to the opcode after the first jump at the start of the program.
;[X] Have the program copy all instructions between the two pointers in memory into a buffer.
;[X] Convert each of the buffer's bytes into its ascii value (0-255).
;[X] Display each of the converted values of the buffer.
;[X] Terminate the process.
