 Code written on 2019_06_07 by Jacob Bethany.
 This is an equivalent to the subset_sum_finder3.php script that I wrote earlier today,
 but written in c. I usee the cpp extension for compilation reasons, on Linux.
 This takes a char * array of the same length as the uint32_t array of values and uses
 it as a mask. 1 = true, 0 = false.
 I've created the same functions to increment the mask array, like with binary addition.

/*
 This performs a faux binary addition upon the mask array to emulate a bitmask of variadic size.
 This could have been optimized by having this work like a real bit mask, just across any number
 of bytes, but this was more simplistic than converting a bit number to a bit and bit number and
 doing the necessary array access and bit manipulations. I may do this later, though, for fun.
